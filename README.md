# my-arch-install
Hey Boys, Girls and anything in between!

In this repository Im showing off my Arch install.
I obviously keep it up-to-date. (if i always remember to (lol))

Terminal: Kitty
Desktop Environment: KDE Plasma 6
Browser: Firefox
File Manager: Dolphin

Color / Themes:

Terminal Color Scheme: "Tokyo Night" from the Kitty Themes.
- Just type "kitten themes" in the kitty terminal. Then search by pressing "/". Then just type Tokyo Night.

KDE Color Scheme: "Tokyo Night". After a while searching i found the perfect color scheme on a github repo. https://github.com/nonetrix/tokyonight-kde/blob/main/TokyoNight.colors
- To Apply it, go to your KDE Colors Settings. You can type in Search "Colors". Then you go to "Install from File". You pick the file and now its installed.
